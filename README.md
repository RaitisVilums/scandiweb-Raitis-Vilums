This test asigment was heavy for me, because it was something new using Class components in React, I started my journey with Funcional components, so it was a new discovery for me. When I learned JavaScript on youtube, many youtubers said that Class isn't very used in JS, because it's a new feature.
I was googling very much to create this project, I hope I didn't use any prohibited things in it.
