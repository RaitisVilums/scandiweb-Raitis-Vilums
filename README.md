I found this assignment to be challenging as it required me to utilize Class components in React, which is a new concept for me as I am more familiar with functional components. When I was learing, reading about JavaScript I found that Class components are not commonly used in JavaScript, so I didn't dive into them.

This assignment allowed me to gain insight into my skills and abilities, and helped me to understand my strengths and weaknesses. It was a great learning opportunity that helped me to improve my understanding of Class components in React and to further develop my coding skills.

I am grateful for the chance to work on this assignment and look forward to applying what I have learned in future projects.

I look forward to receiving feedback on my work and apologize for any delay in submitting the assignment.

Best wishes - Raitis :)
